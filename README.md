This project analyzes MTB trail usage at Raging River, WA, using data derived from a screenshot of Strava’s Global Heatmap.
It is written in R, and I used GIS tools to convert the heatmap into a geospatial file with an adjusted CRS.

The end result is that approximately 18.3% of ground covered within the Raging River trail system occurred more than 5 meters from lawful trails. 
Most of this off-trail travel was concentrated in the Exit 27 area.
